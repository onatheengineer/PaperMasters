Establishing legitimacy on the Blockchain

Papermasters is a decentralized application to fulfill the communities need for better transparency in the Blockchain space.

I coined this new technology 'Non-Fungible Identity' (NFI). It was entirely driven by my desire to maintain the beauty of the Blockchain.

Taking advantage of the ability for a wallet to 'gift' another wallet an NFT, I developed a platform where a wallet can send an NFI to another wallet. This NFI comes in two forms, one a 'good citizen' NFI showing that the wallet can be trusted by the community, and two, an untrusting wallet, showing the community that the wallet has been malicious. 
 
A third function of an NFI is to create a non-government issued Identification (NFI) for peoples that are undocumented. 
 
My hope for this dapp will bring Blockchainers closer so they can continue to grow networking communities that will fight to develop new technologies that will truly bring this world happiness.
